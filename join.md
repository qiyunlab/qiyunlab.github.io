We invite junior researchers who are passionate about microbiomes and computational biology to join our team at ASU! In our lab, you will conduct research on innovative projects that both advance the field and align with your interest. You will receive training in quantitative skills, big data analytics, software development, hypothesis testing, scientific communication, and other valuable aspects of scientific research.

Please email Dr. Qiyun Zhu at **Qiyun.Zhu[at]asu.edu** with your resume/CV and a brief statement of your goal and research interests. This will begin our conversation on potential collaboration.

### What we look for

- Curiosity and passion in scientific research. That's the most important thing!
- Readiness to be a self-motivated researcher.
- Readiness to be a responsible team member.
- Readiness to engage in quantitative research.
- Experience with any of these fields will be a plus (though not required): mathematics, statistics, computer science, machine learning, software engineering, bioinformatics, microbiology, molecular biology, evolutionary biology, ecology, and genetics.

### Graduate students

**We have openings for one or two Ph.D. students** starting in Spring or Fall 2025. Ideal candidates should have a robust interest in quantitative sciences. Prospective students may apply through ASU's various Ph.D. programs, such as [Microbiology](https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/microbiology-phd), [Evolutionary Biology](https://sols.asu.edu/degree/graduate/evolutionary-biology-phd), [Biomedical Informatics](https://chs.asu.edu/masters-degrees-phds/majorinfo/ESBMIPHD/graduate/false/91415), [Biological Design](https://semte.engineering.asu.edu/biological-design-phd/), [Biomedical engineering](https://graduate.engineering.asu.edu/biomedical-engineering/), and [Computer Science](https://degrees.apps.asu.edu/masters-phd/major/ASU00/ESCOMSCPHD/computer-science-phd). You are welcome contact us before applying to discuss potential research projects and funding. This is helpful especially in case we can work together to pursue funding for additional positions, for example through ASU's [Presidential Graduate Assistantship](https://graduate.asu.edu/current-students/funding-opportunities/awards-and-fellowships/presidential-graduate-assistantship) program. We also welcome Master's thesis research, including the [Accelerated Master's](https://admission.asu.edu/academics/accelerated-programs) (4+1) program.

### Undergraduate students

You are welcome to reach out at any time to discuss research opportunities. Please be prepared to dedicate around 10 hours per week to research activities. We facilitate credit registration through undergraduate research courses, and support applications through programs like [Barrett College Fellows](https://students.barretthonors.asu.edu/barrett-fellows), [SOLUR](https://sols.asu.edu/student-life/solur-undergraduate-research-program), and [FURI](https://students.engineering.asu.edu/furi/). Outstanding research contributions may lead to further support for research funding and fellowships.

### Postdocs

We currently do not have funded postdoc positions. However, if you are already supported by external funding, or you are interested in collaborating to apply for postdoctoral training grants or fellowships, we encourage you to contact us. We are keen to support research projects that align with both your interests and ours.
