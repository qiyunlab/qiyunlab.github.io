    subtitle: Mar 01, 2024 | ASU News
    excerpt: >
      Researchers have identified a set of 20 microbes that specialize in decomposing human flesh, offering precise time-of-death estimates in forensic science, regardless of environmental conditions.

  - title: A revolutionary approach to deciphering evolution
    url: https://news.asu.edu/20230828-udance-revolutionary-approach-deciphering-evolution
    subtitle: Aug 28, 2023 | ASU News
    excerpt: >
      A new method revolutionizes phylogenomic tree construction, combining divide-and-conquer strategies with high computing power to integrate and refine vast genetic data, enhancing evolutionary relationship accuracy.

  - title: Integrative Computational Tools for Systems Biology Research

    subtitle: Aug 15, 2023 | U.S. Department of Energy
    excerpt: >
      Multi-institutional team led by Dr. Zhu is funded by the U.S. Department of Energy to expand Python library [scikit-bio](https://scikit.bio) for efficient multiomic data integration and complex community modeling.

  - title: Finding New Ways to Analyze the Microbiome
    url: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9931510
    subtitle: Oct 27, 2022 | IEEE Pulse
    excerpt: >
      The microbiome has a prominent impact on human health, but with microbiomes each comprising trillions of microorganisms such as bacteria, viruses, protozoa, and fungi, and microbes differing from one person to another, much is left to learn.

  - title: A New Way For Probing Gut Microbiome
    url: https://www.asianscientist.com/2022/04/in-the-lab/gut-check/
    subtitle: Apr 25, 2022 | Asian Scientist
    excerpt: >
      We introduce Operational Genomic Units (OGUs) for metagenomic data analysis. The approach allows finer differentiation of DNA sequences, improving upon older methods that rely solely on taxonomic classification. This advancement grants better understanding of microbiomes' role in human health.

  - title: Study describes new method for probing microbiome diversity
    url: https://news.asu.edu/20220405-study-describes-new-method-probing-bewildering-diversity-microbiome
    subtitle: Apr 05, 2022 | ASU News
    excerpt: >
      New analytical technique enhances the resolution of metagenomic sequencing for microbiome analysis. This approach bypasses traditional taxonomy, focusing instead on direct genome alignment for sharper microbial identification and improved biological insights.

  - title: Gut microbe study finds a possible cause of ulcerative colitis
