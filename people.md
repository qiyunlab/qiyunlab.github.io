        This is Qiyun (pronounced as "chee-yeun"), an Assistant Professor at the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, since August 2020. Prior to this appointment, I completed postdoctoral training at UC San Diego with Dr. Rob Knight. My academic background is multidisciplinary, with research experience and interest in bioinformatics, phylogenetics, microbiology, comparative genomics and molecular biology. I study both computational and biological questions, and strive to expand understanding of the microbial world through its multiple levels: genes, genomes, lineages, communities, hosts, and environments.

    excerpt: >
      While I am currently pursuing Neuroscience and Computer Science undergraduate degrees at ASU, I gravitated towards microbiome research in the context of the complex role of the microbiome-gut-brain axis in brain function and neurodegenerative disease. After taking Dr. Zhu's Introduction to Computational Molecular Biology, I was shown the power of applying computational approaches to address biological problems involving large-scale data analysis and I developed a strong interest in the field of bioinformatics. With the Qiyun lab, I am currently gaining experience in building machine learning software packages that bring efficiency to the process of analyzing metagenomic data.
