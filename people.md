        This is Qiyun (pronounced as "chee-yeun"), an Assistant Professor at the School of Life Sciences, Arizona State University, since August 2020. Prior to this appointment, I completed postdoctoral training at UC San Diego with Dr. Rob Knight. My academic background is multidisciplinary, with research experience and interest in bioinformatics, phylogenetics, microbiology, comparative genomics and molecular biology. I study both computational and biological questions, and strive to expand understanding of the microbial world through its multiple levels: genes, genomes, lineages, communities, hosts, and environments.

    excerpt: >
        I am a Postdoctoral Scholar in the Biodesign Center for Fundamental and Applied Microbiomics. Before joining the Qiyun Lab, I completed my dissertation work under the tutelage of [Dr. Ferran Garcia-Pichel](http://garcia-pichel.lab.asu.edu/labo/) where I examined endolithic phototrophs and their accompanying microbiomes. My (micro)biological training has spanned a wide range of topics including synthetic biology, microbial fuel cells, industrial applications of anaerobic extremophiles, and extreme environmental microbiomes. Most recently, I have led the development of databases and tools to help with rapid analysis of environmental microbiomes ([Cydrasil]( https://github.com/FGPLab/cydrasil)). My current research goals are focused on developing and adapting new technologies for use in microbiome analysis and making those new tools easily accessible for every scientist.

    excerpt: >
      I am an undergraduate student at the West campus majoring in Biology and pursuing two certificates in Biomedical Research and Computational Life Sciences. I plan to begin my PhD in Fall 2023 with a focus in microbial ecology for a future career in research. I am passionate about the intersection between microbes, the natural environment, and climate change, specifically how microbial life is shaped under extreme conditions. Besides wet lab work, I find incredible power in bioinformatics tools for analyzing mass microbiome data, utilizing it for my own research. Currently, I am studying black widow microbiomes under the supervision of Dr. Chad Johnson. As a new member in the Qiyun Lab, I am excited to expand my bioinformatics and database skills to study human diseases.
